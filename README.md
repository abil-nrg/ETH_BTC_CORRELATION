# ETH_BTC_CORRELATION
## Intro
In creating a bigger project, I will be building each component seperately first and giving them their own github page. I want to include the correlation of various assets, both the matrix and the rolling corelation time series. This small project will show you the correlation of ETH and BTC daily returns and volume, also the daily correlation of ETC and BTC where one of the assets daily return is lagged by $n$ amount of days. I will present the results in this README, while the code is in cor_mat.ipynb, with the data for BTC and ETH taken from [Kaggle][1] ranging from 2017-2024.
